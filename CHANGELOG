  adding png support because it was so easy (by caedes).

- Fix mouse grabbing (again!)
- Add binary directory to game data path

Quake II 5.23 to 5.24:
- Fix keyboard layouts in the console.

  change the scale of the console and the menu.
- Several bugfixes and improvements to the sound system.
  Some bugs were fixed and the underwater effect is now
  supported in the SDL backend. (by bibendovsky)

  scale the HUD, for high resolutions etc. (by caedes)

  window border" SDL2 problem.

  cvar.

Quake II 5.20 to 5.21:

  or sending SIGTERM. Unix / Linux only.

Quake II 5.11 to 5.20
- Integrate the refresher into the client and
  remove QGL. This means that ref_gl.so is gone
  and libGL is now linked like every other lib.
  (by Alejandro Ricoveri)
- Port the client to SDL 2.0. The newer SDL version
  solves some long standing problems, like broken
  keyboard layouts and non working SDL sound on
  Windows. While SDL 2.0 is enabled by default,
  one can switch back to SDL 1.2 by editing the
  Makefile.
- OS X support was put to hold. While OS X support
  is nice to have, non of the deveolpers has
  interest in maintaining it. Until someone steps
  up and takes responsibility, no OS X versions
  will be released.

Quake II 5.10 to 5.11

- Videos are scaled to 4:3 to prevent distortions.
- Another sound system cleanup.

  Joran and mxmvasilyev0)
- Add a file CONTRIBUTE.
- Some minor changes to the Makefile.

Quake II 4.10 to 4.20
- Add an options framework to allow disabling most
  option features (OGG/Vorbis, ZIP file loading,
  OpenAL, etc) at compile time.
- Integrate OpenAL support, enabling surround sound
  and better stereo sound calculations.
- Enforce the "C" locale to prevent libraries like
  broken LADSPA plugins to override it and break
  printf, scanf, etc.

Quake II 4.03 to 4.10
- Change the behavior of hotkey menus to fix some
  strange bugs and memory leaks in the menu system.
- Add the "gl_farsee" cvar. When set to "1" Quake II
  renders maps up to 4096x4096 units instead of being
  limited to 2300x2300. The default is "0". (by Richard
  Allen)
- Add support for the high resolution retexturing pack.
- Reenable support for gamma via SDL, since the upstream
  bug was fixed with SDL 1.2.15. Gamma via X11 can be
  forced by defining X11GAMMA at compile time.
- Add support for big endian architectures and enable
  the build on SPARC64 CPUs. (by Kieron Gillespie)

  to remote server.
- The game code received a code audit and major rework.

Quake II 3.00RC2 to 3.00
