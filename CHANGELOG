Quake II 8.41 to 8.50:
- Consistent bindings between multiple gamepad types. (by protocultor)
- Improved menu navigation with gamepads. (by protocultor)
- The SDL 3 code now supports the stable SDL 3 API. Several bugs with
  SDL 3 were fixed. (by 0lvin, BjossiAlfreds, erysdren and protocultor)
- Water warp effect for the OpenGL 1.4 renderer. (by protocultor)
- Add a sound backend selector to the menu. (by protocultor)
- Fix several problems with HTTP downloads. (by SiemensSchuckert)
- Better navigation in input fields in the menu. Support left and right
  navigation, add support for the ctrl-l,c,x,v shortcuts. (by
  BjossiAlfreds)
- Performance optimizations for the OpenGL 1.4  renderer, especially on
  embedded and mobile GPUs. Includes an alternative GL ES 1.0 renderer.
  (by protocultor)
- Several fixes to `gl1_stereo`. (by protocultor)

- Support true randomness when shuffling audio tracks. (by
  apartfromtime)
- Fix leaking temporary spawnflags into entities spawned mid-level. (by
  BjossiAlfreds)
- Support the unofficial GL4 renderer lib in the video menu (by atsb)
- Clipboard support for the console and better navigation in the console
  line editor. (By BjossiAlfreds)
- Support player models inside pak files in the menu. (by 0lvin)

  Quake II Remaster maps and the other way round. (by 0lvin)

Quake II 8.40 to 8.41:
- Fix an endless loop in the OpenGL 1.4 renderer crashing the game and
  blocking further progress under some circumstances. (by protocultor)
- Don't force a platform dependend, hard coded SDL audio driver, let SDL
  choose the driver instead. This may fix the SDL audio backend on some
  platforms. The driver can still be overridden by setting `s_sdldriver`
  to something else than `auto`. Under Windows `s_sdldriver` defaults
  `directsound` because `auto` may choose an incompatible driver.

Quake II 8.30 to 8.40:
- Implement `g_quick_weap`. If set to 1, both weapprev and weapnext
  commands will count how many times they have been called, making
  possible to skip weapons by quickly tapping one of these keys. (by
  protocultor)
- Fix `gl1_overbrightbits`, allowed values are now 0, 1, 2 and 4. (by
  protocultor)
- Sort player skins case insensitive. (by apartfromtime)
- Implement `cl_showspeed` to show the current player speed (by Feels
  Duck Man)

  `gl1_multitexture`, enabled by default. (by protocultor)
- Optimize dynamic lights and texture allocation in the OpenGL 1.4
  renderer. (by protocultor)
- Implement gyro tightening for gamepads and joysticks. (by protocultor)
- Support long player skin names. (by 0lvin)
- Add a very simple download filter. Files ending in .dll, .dylib and
  .so are always filtered to prevent code injection.
- Don't load OpenAL and cURL libraries if thy are configured with a full
  or relative path.
- Work around naggy help icons. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Group draw call in GL1. This yields huge performance gains on slow
  GPUs. (by protocultor)

Quake II 8.20 to 8.30:
- Use the same image loading code in all renderers. (by 0lvin)
- Use the same model loading code in all renderers. (by 0lvin)
- Remove the unused `msg` cvar and the corresponding server side
  infrastructure. The cvar was never implemented in Quake II, but
  existing bits could be used for attacks against the client.
- Add `cl_audiopaused`. When set to `1` the audio stops when the
  game is paused. (by David Carlier)
- Add `ogg_pausewithgame`. When set to `1` the background music stops
  when the game is paused. (by apartfromtime)
- New logo files, matching the original Quake II logo. (by SirYodaJedi)
- Support for RISCV64 (by David Carlier)
- Fix resetting Mods back to baseq2 when running with `-portable`.
- Alternative playback modes for OGG/Vorbis background music: once,
  sequential, random. (by apartfromtime)
- Support gyro aiming for Switch controllers with SDL < 2.0.14. (by
  protocultor)
- Fixed stand-ground gladiators not attacking within a certain range.
  (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Fixed monsters seeing players during intermissions. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Several fixes to Makron. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Optional high dpi awareness when running under Wayland. Requires a
  Wayland compositor supporting fractional-scale-v1 and at least SDL
  2.26. Set `vid_highdpiawareness 1` to enable.
- Fix lava surfaces not glowing.
- Add a cheat protected cvar `g_swap_speed`. Allows to skip frames of
  "putting down weapon" and "raising weapon" animations, speeding them
  up. (by protocultor)
- Support of RGBA png/jpg image with r_retexturing as cinematic. (by
  0lvin)

Quake II 8.10 to 8.20:
- This release marks Quake IIs 25th anniversary. Happy Birthday!
- Various improvements to the menu. This includes updates to the menu
  framework itself, to the game controller menu, the savegame menu and
  the video menus. (by apartfromtime, protocultor, David Carlier and
  0lvin)
- A lot of fixes and improvements to the controller support. Support for
  gyro aiming, more precise stick handling and rumble improvements. (by
  protocultor)
- Implement faster weapon switching with the new 'cycleweap' command.
  (by protocultor).
- Fixes pusher delta yaw manipulation. This fixes the infamous bug were
  a player standing on a blocked elevator gets turned around (by
  skuller).
- Add a command 'spawnentity' to spawn entities at the given
  coordinates. Can be used for debugging. (by 0lvin)
- Ported monster footstep sounds from SkacikPLs Q2RTX fork. Needs a pak
  file with assets to work, see the documentation for details. (by
  0lvin)
- Ported reverb effects from SkacikPLs Q2RTX fork. (by 0lvin)
- Fix several coop related bugs with the powercubes. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- A way better fix for dead bodies obstructing elevators or falling
  through the worldmodel. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Fix items already in water playing a splash sound at level start. (by
  BjossiAlfreds)
- Pause the game when getting minimized or hidden. (by David Carlier)
- Fix Bugs related to 'ogg_ignoretrack0'. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Share model loading code between renderers. (by 0lvin)
- Restore stair step smoothing for step sizes other than 16.
- Fix playback of long audio samples (>10 seconds) through OpenAL.

Quake II 8.01 to 8.10:
- The OpenGL 3.2 renderer now supports the classic underwater effect.
  Until now it was only available in the Software renderer.
- Add 'ref_gles3', an OpenGL ES 3.0 renderer lib. This is an variant
  of the OpenGL 3.2 renderer, using OpenGL ES instead of desktop OpenGL.
  It greatly enhances support for embedded GPUs like the RaspberryPI 4.
- The Software renderer now supports colored lighting. It can be
  enabled through `sw_colorlight`. (by 0lvin)
- Another round of timing fixes. Implement `cl_maxfps -1` (the new
  default, existing configs are not altered) to automatically select
  a known to be good packet framerate depending on the current renderer
  framerate. This solves some subtile problems with stuttering entities.
- Greatly improved support for joysticks and controllers. Devices can
  now be hotplugged at runtime, binding should be portable between
  different controllers and there's a new menu for controller bindings.
  (by protocultor)
- Add the `r_2D_unfiltered` and `r_videos_unfiltered` cvars. When
  enabled 2D elements like the HUD and videos are not filtered, they
  appear pixeled.
- Add 'prefweap' command to select weapon by priority. (by protocultor)
- Support building with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and newer.
- Several game code fixes, mostly for stuck mechanics in fact2. (by
  BjossiAlfreds and maraakate)
- Fix two stuck monsters in hangar1 and jail5. (by Dremor8484 and
  BjossiAlfreds)
- Fix the `viewsize` cvar.

Quake II 8.00 to 8.01:
- Fix the game not starting when nonexistent dirs in the search path.
- Sync haptic joystick effects to the sound. (by 0lvin)
- Move several map bug fixes to entity files, add some more map bug
  fixes. Without entity files the maps are the same as in Vanilla Quake
  II. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Play the correct demo loop after changing the current mod.
- Fix numbered paks with upper case letters added twice to the search
  path. Only Windows was affected.
- `g_footsteps 2` now only generate footstep sound when the player is on
  the ground entity and no longer when in water or air.
- Add a cvar `g_machinegun_norecoil' which disables the machinegun
  recoil effect. This is cheat protected. (by De-Deppe)
- Scale 8 bit textures when `r_scale8bittextures` is set. (by 0lvin)
- The game is no longer limited to 1000 FPS when running in timedemo
  mode. (by 0lvin)
- Optimise command line parser and fix several subtle bugs. (by
  BjossiAlfreds)
- Add `r_2D_unfiltered`, when set to `1` 2D elements aren't filtered.
- Fix soldiers never showing their pain skin as long as they're alive.
- Fix relative paths in ZIP files not being found.
- Add `gamemode` command for changing between singleplayer, deathmatch
  and coop. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Show a download progress bar when `cl_http_show_dw_progress` is set to
  `1`. (by David Carlier)

Quake II 7.45 to 8.00:
- Client side support for the optional Vulkan renderer library.
- Non existent renderer libraries are now skipped over by the menu.
- Fix several bugs when loading autosaves.
- Bump the maximal number of OGG/Vorbis files to 128.
- Several fixes to the Barracuda Shark. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- 'vid_fullscreen' and 'r_mode' are no longer special, they require an
  explicit 'vid_restart' like every other cvar.
- Remove hardcoded map fixes and replace them by optional entity files.
  Add several newly discovered map fixes. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Send the network protocol version to the server. This can be used by
  the server to support clients with different network protocol version.
  (by Knightmare)
- Force SDL to minimize the window when its focus is lost. This fixes
  several problem under Windows with SDL 2.0.14 and newer.
- Switch the semantics of the 'vid_fullscreen' cvar. '1' is now native
  fullscreen, like it was in Vanilla Quake II. '2' is desktop
  fullscreen. When desktop fullscreen is selected through the menu,
  'r_mode' is forced to '-2'.
- Add 'g_footsteps' to control the generation of footstep sound. This
  cvar is cheat protected. '1' is Vanilla Quake II behavior and the
  default. '0' never generates footstep sound, '2' always generates
  them.
- Support stereo wave files. (by 0lvin)
- Add 'cl_r1q2_lighstyle'. When set to '1' Yamagi Quake II uses the
  Vanilla Quake II light styles (for example yellow light for the
  Hyperblaster) instead of the default r1q2 light styles.
- Add a submenu to configure gamepad and joystick sensitivities. (by
  Larry Davis)
- Ensure that the config file is written before changing the active mod.
  This prevents config changes from getting lost.
- Overhaul the search path logic. Make sure that each directory is added
  only once.

Quake II 7.44 to 7.45:
- Fix a crash under windows when opening the games menu with mods
  installed.

Quake II 7.43 to 7.44:
- Fix some input option not getting saved.
- Limit busywaits to the full client. This lowers the cpu consumption
  of q2ded considerably.
- Rework the build system to be more distribution friendly. The base
  CFLAGS and LDFLAGS can now be overridden by the environment and by
  options passed to make. (by Simon McVittie)
- Fix some corner cases of broken IPv6 connectivity.
- Fix qport colliding between several Yamagi Quake II clients.
- Keyboard keys unknown to Yamagi Quake II can now be bound.
- Adaptive vsync is now supported by setting 'r_vsync' to '1'.
- Implement 'coop_pickup_weapons'. When set to '1', a weapon may be
  picked up by coop players if the player doesn't have the weapon in
  their inventory or no other player has already picked it up.
- In coop elevators wait for 'coop_elevator_delay' seconds.
- If 'cl_anglekick' is set '1' angle kicks are ignored. This breaks
  the gameplay a little bit, but helps against motion sickness. This
  cvar is cheat protected.
- Add 'listmaps' command and autocompletion for maps. (by JBerg)
- Make 'wait' in scripts wait for 17 ms. This fixes some movement
  makros.
- Support for Haiku. (by David Carlier)
- Add a 'mods' submenu. (by earth-metal)
- Add the 'vstr' command and 'nextdemo' cvar. Ported from ioquake3.
  (by Denis Pauk)

Quake II 7.42 to 7.43:
- Recover from a lost sound device, do not crash of no sound device is
  available. This fixes several problem with DisplayPort and HDMI audio,
  especially with the Intel Windows GPU drivers.
- Several small game logic fixes. This includes a fix for a potential
  progress blocker in 'The Torture Chambers' introduced in the last
  release. (by BjossiAlfreds)
- Add the 'gl1_particle_square' cvar, it forces square particles in
  the GL1 renderer. (by Mason UnixBeard)
- The software renderer is no longer experimental.
- Add an option to configure the gun Z offset in the software renderer.

Quake II 7.41 to 7.42:
- The console can now be scrolled with the mouse wheel. (by maxcrofts)
- Fix entities on non-horizontal surfaces rendered in full black.
- Add an option to choose the display Quake II runs on. (by Spirrwell)
- Add an option to specify the display refresh rate used in fullscreen.
- Allow mouse 'sensitivity' to be set to non-integral values.
- Port cvar operations from q2pro. These allow the manipulation of cvar
  values, supported are: dec, inc, reset, resetall and toggle
- Put the client into pause mode during savegame load. This prevents the
  world getting forwarded about 100 frames during load, time in which
  the player might be hurt by monsters or the environment.
- New commands: 'listentities' allows listing of entities. 'teleport'
  teleports the player to the given coordinates.
- Fix loading of config files not ending in newlines.
- A lot of fixes for subtle, long standing AI and game play bugs. (by
  BjossiAlfreds)
- Quicksaves can now be loaded and saved throught the savegame menus.
- The software renderer now skips frames with no changes. This improves
  performance quite a bit, especially on slow CPUs. (by Denis Pauk)

Quake II 7.40 to 7.41:
- Some bugfixes to HTTP downloads introduced in 7.40.
- Fix several crashes when loading savegames in coop.
- Fix some out of memory aborts when loading maps with a lot surfaces.
- Allow autodetection of the desktop resolution. Set 'r_mode' to '-2' to
  enable that. (by Denis Pauk)
- Several fixes to the OpenGL 3.2 renderer. Some dynamic lights were
  missing, for example for most explosions. Stencil shadows were broken
  under some conditions. Performance was bad with the AMD driver under
  Windows. Intel Ivy Bridge didn't work. Under some conditions lights
  were too bright.
- Add an optional fix for lighting problems in maps that misuse sky
  surfaces for interior lighting. Set 'gl_fixsurfsky' to '1' to enable
  it.
- Another bunch of timing fixes. The game should now hold the framerate
  under all conditions, even with crappy Windows GPU drivers.
- The quake2.exe wrapper forces the Quake II window into focus. This
  prevents Quake II starting in background.

Quake II 7.30 to 7.40:
- Add support for HTTP downloads. Both the r1q2 and q2pro URL schemes
  are supported, if a file is unavailable over HTTP the download code
  falls back to UDP.
- Savegames can be removed through the menu by pressing 'del' on the
  selected savegame. (by Jonathan Bergeron)
- Support external entity files. This was submitted by @NeonKnightOA.
- Some fixes to OGG/Vorbis music playback. The music keeps playing after
  s_restart and ogg_shuffle is handled correctly by the menu.
- Another round of timing fixes. Average frame times are now taken into
  account when taking an educated guess on the next frames render time.
  And the display refresh rate detection no longer cripple working GPU
  drivers in an efford to work around bugs in older version of AMDs.
- A lot of fixes to the internal memory management. The game is now
  much more memory efficient, this allows playing of extremely big maps
  without crashes. This is largely based upon work done by Denis Pauk.
- New and much more detailed documentation.
- Enhancements to the software renderer. Retexturing packs are now
  supported, general cleanup and bugfixes. (by Denis Pauk)

Quake II 7.21 to 7.30:
- Removed support for SDL 1.2.
- Removed static dependencies to libogg, libvorbis and libz.
- Fixed several bugs regarding render- and fullscreen switch.
- A lot of fixes and improvements to the software renderer. It's now
  able to render the whole game without artifacts and much faster than
  before. (by Denis Pauk)

Quake II 7.20 to 7.21:
- Fix some render glitches in the software renderer. (by Denis Pauk)
- Render the weapon independent of the current field of view, otherwise
  the weapon distorts with very high FOV settings. The weapons FOV can
  be set through r_gunfov, it defaults to 90.
- Rework the OGG/Vorbis backend. This fixes several annoying bugs, and
  adds support for alternative track <=> file mappings. Use this to
  implement support for the audio tracks supplied by the GOG.com version
  of Quake II.

Quake II 7.10 to 7.20:
- Add the soft renderer back. This feature is considered experimental.
  The porting of the old soft renderer code to SDL and it's cleanup
  were done by Denis Pauk.
- Rename several cvars to be consistent across different renderers.
  The configuration file will be converted at the first start, when an
  old cvar name is used a message is printed.
- Make the client unicode compatible. Yamagi Quake II can now be 
  installed into paths with unicode characters in it. On Windows the
  user name of the current account may contain unicode characters.
  As a side effect the game can run on ReFS volumes. While '+set
  basedir' is still supported, the unicode compatible '-datadir'
  should be used.
- Another round of timing fixes. The game is now capable of holding
  the requestes or vsync framerate even on slow machines and with
  problematic GL drivers.
- Fix server side mod handling, their configs are now saved to the
  correct directories and the configs are reexeced at mod startup.

Quake II 7.02 to 7.10:
- Joystick support including haptic feedback. This fantastic work was
  done by Denis Pauk. The dirty work is done by SDL, how good or bad
  a joystick or gamepad is supported depends on SDLs support for it.
- Fix the old SDL sound backend, s_openal set to 0 is working again.
- Fix possible Vorbis buffer underruns if too many sound samples are
  in flight. This occured only in large multi player games with at
  least 6 custom models.
- Fix a possible crash on Windows if MSAA was set to a value not
  supported by the driver.
- It's now possible to play through the whole game on a Raspberry PI
  and other ARM boards. Please note that the RPIs hardware is really
  limited. Only the OpenGL 1.4 renderer is supported and the framerate
  is highly dependend on the screen resolution.

Quake II 7.01 to 7.02:
- Fix several corner cases regarding render library loading. The game
  should now always fall back to the OpenGL 1.4 renderer if the new
  OpenGL 3.2 renderer can't be initialized. Also the game aborts if no
  useable OpenGL implementation exists.
- Refactor the search path code. This should fix several bugs with
  Quake II writing to the wrong directories or being unable to find
  some / all assets.
- Reimplement portable binaries. If called with the -portable command
  line option Quake II saves all data (configs, savegames, screenshorts
  etc.) into it's systemwide installation directory and not users home
  directory. In contrast to the old implementation on Windows stdout.txt
  contains all output, the first lines are no longer missing.
- vid_fullscreen set to 1 now keeps the desktops resolution. Set it to 2
  to change the resolution.
- Instead of a list with precalculated FOV values the video menu now
  shows a slider with possible values from 60 to 120. Horplus is now
  always enabled, set the horplus cvar to 0 to disable it.
- The game is now able to hold the requested framerate (either by the
  vsync or the gl_maxfps cvar) with an accuracy of about +/- 1% as long
  as the hardware is fast enough.  The framecounter was reimplemented
  to be much more precise.
- Fix mispredictions if an original client running on Win32 connects
  to a Yamagi Quake II server running on Linux/i386.

Quake II 7.00 to 7.01:
- Fix build of GL3 for platforms without SSE.
- Fix Jennel Jaquays name in credits and quit screen.
- Make Quake II high DPI aware on Window Vista and above.
- Fix some problems with loading dependend librarys on Windows.

Quake II 6.00 to 7.00:
- Remove the broken multitexturing render path from the OpenGL 1.4
  renderer. It was switched off by default in 6.00.
- Reimplement the support for shared renderer libraries. Please note
  the this is an incompatible implementation with an custom API. The
  original renderer libraries will not work!
- Implement an OpenGL 3.2 renderer. This renderer has the same look
  and feel as the old OpenGL 1.4 renderer but makes heavy use of
  modern OpenGL and GPU features. An OpenGL 3.2 capable GPU (Intel
  starting with Ivy Bridge on Windows or Sandy Bridge on Linux, Nvidia
  staring with G80 and AMD starting with R600 / HD2000) is required.
- Fix OpenAL compatibility with modern openal-soft versions.
- Several fixes and optimizations to OpenAL, implement support for
  doppler effects. (by xorw)

Quake II 5.34 to 6.00:
- Make the client asynchronous. The old behaviour can be forced by
  setting cl_async to 0. Please note that asynchronicity can lead to
  problems if the old SDL 1.2 backend is used and vsync is enabled.
- Implement gl_overbrightbits in the non multitexturing case.  A value
  of 1 just fixes lighting on water surfaces, higher values increase
  the brightness of everything.
- General renderer overhaul for better compatibility with modern GPUs.
  OpenGL 1.4 is now required, older versions are no longer supported.
  Multitexturing was deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- Fix some longstanding AI problems.
- Several general gameplay fixes.

Quake II 5.33 to 5.34:
- Add support for stereo 3D (by Valery Guskov)
- Make gibs solid so they move with conveyor belts.
- Disable gl_ext_multitexturing by default.
- Switch from an arch whitelist to an "all archs are supported"
  approach.

- Overhauled retexturing support, replacing libjpeg with stb_image,
  adding png support because it was so easy (by caedes).
- Fix gamma (was broken in last release)
- Fix mouse grabbing (again!)
- Add binary directory to game data path

Quake II 5.23 to 5.24:
- Fix keyboard layouts in the console.
- Use GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two if it's supported by the GPU.
- Provide gl_consolescale and gl_menuscale cvars to change the scale
  of the console and the menu.
- Several bugfixes and improvements to the sound system.  Some bugs
  were fixed and the underwater effect is now supported in the SDL
backend. (by bibendovsky)

Quake II 5.22 to 5.23:
- Provide gl_hudscale cvar that can be changed to scale the HUD, for
  high resolutions etc. (by caedes)
- Several menu improvements.
- A better work around for the "the mouse cursor hits the window
  border" SDL2 problem.

Quake II 5.21 to 5.22:
- Provide a fallback if SDL2s relative mouse mode cannot be activated.
- Add support for MSAA through the gl_msaa_samples cvar.

Quake II 5.20 to 5.21:
- Fix a bug regarding mouse key handling (reported by phenixia2003)
- Correct MS Windows builds. Add official support for Win64. This
  still needs some testing.
- Allow to shutdown the client by pressing ctrl-c or sending SIGTERM.
  Unix / Linux only.

Quake II 5.11 to 5.20
- Integrate the refresher into the client and remove QGL. This means
  that ref_gl.so is gone and libGL is now linked like every other lib.
  (by Alejandro Ricoveri)
- Port the client to SDL 2.0. The newer SDL version solves some long
  standing problems, like broken keyboard layouts and non working SDL
  sound on Windows. While SDL 2.0 is enabled by default, one can switch
  back to SDL 1.2 by editing the Makefile.
- OS X support was put to hold. While OS X support is nice to have,
  non of the deveolpers has interest in maintaining it. Until someone
  steps up and takes responsibility, no OS X versions will be released.

Quake II 5.10 to 5.11
- A lot of bugfixes.
- Videos are scaled to 4:3 to prevent distortions.
- Another sound system cleanup.

Quake II 5.00 to 5.10
- Support for OS X. (by W. Beser)
- Correct field of view handling (by Ricardo Garci)
- Many improvements to the mouse release code (by svdijk)

Quake II 4.21 to 5.00
- Backport to Microsoft Windows.
- Support for OpenBSD. (by Jonathan Gray)
- Aspect ration can be set via the video menu.
- A better random number generator.
- The SDL sound driver is now selectable by "s_sdldriver".

Quake II 4.20 to 4.21
- Fix several segfaults with OpenAL. (reported by Joran and
  mxmvasilyev0)
- Add a file CONTRIBUTE.
- Some minor changes to the Makefile.

Quake II 4.10 to 4.20
- Add an options framework to allow disabling most option features
  (OGG/Vorbis, ZIP file loading, OpenAL, etc) at compile time.
- Integrate OpenAL support, enabling surround sound and better stereo
  sound calculations.
- Enforce the "C" locale to prevent libraries like broken LADSPA
  plugins to override it and break printf, scanf, etc.

Quake II 4.03 to 4.10
- Change the behavior of hotkey menus to fix some strange bugs and
  memory leaks in the menu system.
- Add the "gl_farsee" cvar. When set to "1" Quake II renders maps up
  to 4096x4096 units instead of being limited to 2300x2300. The
  default is "0". (by Richard Allen)
- Add support for the high resolution retexturing pack.
- Reenable support for gamma via SDL, since the upstream bug was fixed
  with SDL 1.2.15. Gamma via X11 can be forced by defining X11GAMMA at
  compile time.
- Add support for big endian architectures and enable the build on
  SPARC64 CPUs. (by Kieron Gillespie)

Quake II 4.02 to 4.03
- Fix wrong function call in the Quake II file system.
- Fix gl_ext_multitexture set to 1. (reported by Richard Allen and
  Lukas Sabota)
- Print the version number in the window title.

Quake II 4.01 to 4.02
