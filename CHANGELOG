Quake II 7.30 to 7.40:
- Add support for HTTP downloads. Both the r1q2 and q2pro URL schemes
  are supported, if a file is unavailable over HTTP the download code
  falls back to UDP.
- Savegames can be removed through the menu by pressing 'del' on the
  selected savegame. (by Jonathan Bergeron)
- Support external entity files. This was submitted by @NeonKnightOA.
- Some fixes to OGG/Vorbis music playback. The music keeps playing after
  s_restart and ogg_shuffle is handled correctly by the menu.
- Another round of timing fixes. Average frame times are now taken into
  account when taking an educated guess on the next frames render time.
  And the display refresh rate detection no longer cripple working GPU
  drivers in an efford to work around bugs in older version of AMDs.
- A lot of fixes to the internal memory management. The game is now
  much more memory efficient, this allows playing of extremly big maps
  without crashes. This is largly based upon work done by Denis Pauk.
- New and much more detailed documentation.
- Enhancements to the software renderer. Retexturing packs are now
  supported, general cleanup and bugfixes. (by Denis Pauk)

Quake II 7.21 to 7.30:
- Removed support for SDL 1.2.
- Removed static dependencies to libogg, libvorbis and libz.
- Fixed several bugs regarding render- and fullscreen switch.
- A lot of fixes and improvements to the software renderer. It's now
  able to render the whole game without artifacts and much faster than
  before. (by Denis Pauk)

Quake II 7.20 to 7.21:
- Fix some render glitches in the software renderer. (by Denis Pauk)
- Render the weapon independent of the current field of view, otherwise
  the weapon distorts with very high FOV settings. The weapons FOV can
  be set through r_gunfov, it defaults to 90.
- Rework the OGG/Vorbis backend. This fixes several annoying bugs, and
  adds support for alternative track <=> file mappings. Use this to
  implement support for the audio tracks supplied by the GOG.com version
  of Quake II.

Quake II 7.10 to 7.20:
- Add the soft renderer back. This feature is considered experimental.
  The porting of the old soft renderer code to SDL and it's cleanup
  were done by Denis Pauk.
- Rename several cvars to be consistent across different renderers.
  The configuration file will be converted at the first start, when an
  old cvar name is used a message is printed.
- Make the client unicode compatible. Yamagi Quake II can now be 
  installed into pathes with unicode characters in it. On Windows the
  user name of the current account may contain unicode characters.
  As a side effect the game can run on ReFS volumes. While '+set
  basedir' is still supported, the unicode compatible '-datadir'
  should be used.
- Another round of timing fixes. The game is now capable of holding
  the requestes or vsync framerate even on slow machines and with
  problematic GL drivers.
- Fix server side mod handling, their configs are now saved to the
  correct directories and the configs are reexeced at mod startup.

Quake II 7.02 to 7.10:
- Joystick support including haptic feedback. This fantastic work was
  done by Denis Pauk. The dirty work is done by SDL, how good or bad
  a joystick or gamepad is supported depends on SDLs support for it.
- Fix the old SDL sound backend, s_openal set to 0 is working again.
- Fix possible Vorbis buffer underruns if too many sound samples are
  in flight. This occured only in large multi player games with at
  least 6 custom models.
- Fix a possible crash on Windows if MSAA was set to a value not
  supported by the driver.
- It's now possible to play through the whole game on a Raspberry PI
  and other ARM boards. Please note that the RPIs hardware is really
  limited. Only the OpenGL 1.4 renderer is supported and the framerate
  is highly dependend on the screen resolution.

Quake II 7.01 to 7.02:
- Fix several corner cases regarding render library loading. The game
  should now always fall back to the OpenGL 1.4 renderer if the new
  OpenGL 3.2 renderer can't be initialized. Also the game aborts if no
  useable OpenGL implementation exists.
- Refactor the search path code. This should fix several bugs with
  Quake II writing to the wrong directories or being unable to find
  some / all assets.
- Reimplement portable binaries. If called with the -portable command
  line option Quake II saves all data (configs, savegames, screenshorts
  etc.) into it's systemwide installation directory and not users home
  directory. In contrast to the old implementation on Windows stdout.txt
  contains all output, the first lines are no longer missing.
- vid_fullscreen set to 1 now keeps the desktops resolution. Set it to 2
  to change the resolution.
- Instead of a list with precalculated FOV values the video menu now
  shows a slider with possible values from 60 to 120. Horplus is now
  always enabled, set the horplus cvar to 0 to disable it.
- The game is now able to hold the requested framerate (either by the
  vsync or the gl_maxfps cvar) with an accuracy of about +/- 1% as long
  as the hardware is fast enough.  The framecounter was reimplemented
  to be much more precise.
- Fix misspredictions if an original client running on Win32 connects
  to a Yamagi Quake II server running on Linux/i386.

Quake II 7.00 to 7.01:
- Fix build of GL3 for platforms without SSE.
- Fix Jennel Jaquays name in credits and quit screen.
- Make Quake II high DPI aware on Window Vista and above.
- Fix some problems with loading dependend librarys on Windows.

Quake II 6.00 to 7.00:
- Remove the broken multitexturing render path from the OpenGL 1.4
  renderer. It was switched off by default in 6.00.
- Reimplement the support for shared renderer libraries. Please note
  the this is an incompatible implementation with an custom API. The
  original renderer libraries will not work!
- Implement an OpenGL 3.2 renderer. This renderer has the same look
  and feel as the old OpenGL 1.4 renderer but makes heavy use of
  modern OpenGL and GPU features. An OpenGL 3.2 capable GPU (Intel
  starting with Ivy Bridge on Windows or Sandy Bridge on Linux, Nvidia
  staring with G80 and AMD starting with R600 / HD2000) is required.
- Fix OpenAL compatibility with modern openal-soft versions.
- Several fixes and optimizations to OpenAL, implement support for
  doppler effects. (by xorw)

Quake II 5.34 to 6.00:
- Make the client asynchronous. The old behaviour can be forced by
  setting cl_async to 0. Please note that asynchronicity can lead to
  problems if the old SDL 1.2 backend is used and vsync is enabled.
- Implement gl_overbrightbits in the non multitexturing case.  A value
  of 1 just fixes lighting on water surfaces, higher values increase
  the brightness of everything.
- General renderer overhaul for better compatibility with modern GPUs.
  OpenGL 1.4 is now required, older versions are no longer supported.
  Multitexturing was deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- Fix some longstanding AI problems.
- Several general gameplay fixes.

  were fixed and the underwater effect is now supported in the SDL
backend. (by bibendovsky)

Quake II 5.22 to 5.23:
- Provide gl_hudscale cvar that can be changed to scale the HUD, for
  high resolutions etc. (by caedes)

  still needs some testing.
- Allow to shutdown the client by pressing ctrl-c or sending SIGTERM.
  Unix / Linux only.

Quake II 5.11 to 5.20
- Integrate the refresher into the client and remove QGL. This means
  that ref_gl.so is gone and libGL is now linked like every other lib.
  (by Alejandro Ricoveri)
- Port the client to SDL 2.0. The newer SDL version solves some long
  standing problems, like broken keyboard layouts and non working SDL
  sound on Windows. While SDL 2.0 is enabled by default, one can switch
  back to SDL 1.2 by editing the Makefile.
- OS X support was put to hold. While OS X support is nice to have,
  non of the deveolpers has interest in maintaining it. Until someone
  steps up and takes responsibility, no OS X versions will be released.

  (OGG/Vorbis, ZIP file loading, OpenAL, etc) at compile time.
- Integrate OpenAL support, enabling surround sound and better stereo
  sound calculations.
- Enforce the "C" locale to prevent libraries like broken LADSPA
  plugins to override it and break printf, scanf, etc.

Quake II 4.03 to 4.10
- Change the behavior of hotkey menus to fix some strange bugs and
  memory leaks in the menu system.
- Add the "gl_farsee" cvar. When set to "1" Quake II renders maps up
  to 4096x4096 units instead of being limited to 2300x2300. The
  default is "0". (by Richard Allen)
- Add support for the high resolution retexturing pack.
- Reenable support for gamma via SDL, since the upstream bug was fixed
  with SDL 1.2.15. Gamma via X11 can be forced by defining X11GAMMA at
  compile time.
