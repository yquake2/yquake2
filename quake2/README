This is the Yamagi Quake II Client, an enhanced Version of id Software's
Quake II. Main focus is single player, the gameplay and the graphics are
unchanged but many bugs were fixed. Other than most other Quake II ports
Yamagi Quake II is full 64 bit clean thus and works perfekt on modern
amd64 prozessors and operating system This code should run on most
unixlike operating system, just type "make" oder "gmake" to compile.

This code is based upon Icculus Quake II, which itself is build upon id
Software's original code drop. Additional code and patches by many
contributers were used. It's released under the terms of the GPL version
2. You can read the whole licence under http://www.gnu.org/.

1. Installation
==============
Note: If you're using Debian Linux or a derived Distribution like
Ubuntu, you probably want to use the packages that are linked in the
Download section at http://www.yamagi.org/quake2. They'll even assist
you in installing the game data.

1.1 Retail version:
-------------------
If you own Quake II, first get the official point release to Quake II
3.20: ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-3.20-x86-full-ctf.exe
Use this and only this file! Unofficial "linux pointreleases" or something
like that will not work and crash your game!

Create a new directory "quake2/" and extract the file you just
downloaded into it. Even if the file extension is ".exe" it's just a
normal zip file. Now delete the following files and directories:
- 3.20_Changes.txt 
- index.html 
- quake2.exe 
- ref_gl.dll 
- ref_soft.dll 
- baseq2/gamex86.dll 
- baseq2/maps.lst 
- ctf/ctf2.ico 
- ctf/gamex86.dll 
- ctf/readme.txt 
- ctf/server.cfg 
- DOCS/ 
- xatrix/gamex86.dll 
- rogue/gamex86.dll

Now put the Quake II CD-ROM into your cd drive and copy the file
"pak0.pak" and the directory "video/" to the baseq2-directory of your
installation.

1.2 Demo version:
-----------------
If you haven't got Quake II, try the demo version. Get it here: 
ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-314-demo-x86.exe

Create a new quake2/ directory with a baseq2/ sub-directory and put the
pak0.pak and the players/ sub-directory you can find within the unzipped
files (in Install/Data/baseq2/) in your baseq2-directory. No patching
is needed for the demo, in fact it would break it.

1.3 Addons
----------
Due to license issues - Yamagi Quake II is covered by the GPL and the
addons are under the id Software SDK license - the addons are
distributed seperatly. You can get them at http://www.yamagi.org/quake2,
both contains installation instructions. But nevertheless you'll need
the client and the main game installed for playing them.

1.4 Dependencies:
-----------------
 - X11 Windows System with development headers
 - OpenGL system headers (Mesa3D, nVidia, fglrx, etc.)
 - libvorbis with development headers
 - libogg with development headers
 - ZLib
 - SDL with development headers and sdl-config(1)

1.5 Compiling:
--------------
After you have set up the game data (from the full version or the
demo), you have to compile the Yamagi Quake II client. Just extract the
source, change into the new created directory and type "make" (Linux) or
"gmake" (FreeBSD). After the compilation finished copy the following
files out of release/ to your installation directory preserving the
directory structure:
- q2ded 
- quake2 
- ref_gl.so 
- baseq2/game.so 
- ctf/game.so (not for the demo version)

You should now be ready to start your brand new Quake II. Have fun.

===============================================================================

2. OGG/Vorbis playback
======================
Since most modern CD-ROM and DVD drives don't have an analog audio
output and most sound codecs don't have the appropriate input header,
it's no longer possible to play Quake II with the original Audio-CD for
background music. Therefore OGG/Vorbis playback has been added to Yamagi
Quake II. It can play the original soundtrack, like if the CD is in the
drive or customized playlists.

2.1 Setup for the original soundtrack:
--------------------------------------
Put your Quake II CD-ROM in your drive, start your favorite CD extractor
and rip the audiotracks into OGG/Vorbis files. These files must be named
after their track number. Remember! Since the first track on the CD ist
"data", the first audio track is number 2! If everything is done
correct, you should have: 02.ogg, 03.ogg, ..., 11.ogg. Alternatively you
can use a script provided by caedes, which can be found in the folder
"tools". It needs cdparanoia and oggenc, it should work with the main
game and both addons.
Put these files under baseq2/music, start Quake II, enter the "Options"
menu and set "OGG music" to enabled. "CD music" will be automaticly
disabled. Quake II will now play the OGG/Vorbis files instead of the
Audio-CD.

2.2 Setup for other music and playlists:
----------------------------------------
You can put normal OGG/Vorbis files into baseq2/music or your_mod/music.
If shuffle is enabled, Quake II will shuffle through all files.
Otherwise it will loop through the track associated with the map.
Therefore playlists can be used. Just put the filenames into
music/playlists (a plain text file) and start the game. For manuell
control there are some cvar. Remember, these are only available, if "OGG
music" is enabled!

2.3 Manual control:
-------------------
- ogg_play {file | #n | ? | >n | <n}
 Play a file, the argument can be one of:
  * A file in "music", without the path and ".ogg" extension.
  * A # followed by a number, to play the Nth file in the playlist.
  * A ? which indicates to play a random file.
  * A > which indicates to advance N positions (defaults to 1).
  * A < which indicates to go back N positions (defaults to 1). 

- ogg_stop
 Stop playing the current file

- ogg_pause
 Pause the current file

- ogg_resume
 Resume the current file.

- ogg_seek {n | >n | <n}
 Go to a determinated position of the file in seconds, the argument can be
 one of the following:
  * n, which indicates to go to the nth position.
  * >n, which indicates to advance n positions.
  * <n, which indicates to go back n positions.
 You can use "ogg_seek >0" and "ogg_seek <0" to get the current position
 without changing it.

- ogg_status
 Display status (if playing a file, if paused, if stopped, etc.).

2.4 Console variables:
----------------------
- ogg_enable {0 | 1}
 Enable the Ogg Vorbis subsystem when in "1". Defaults to "0".

- ogg_playlist {name}
 Use "name" as a list of files instead of listing the contents of "music". 
 Note that the files must be in "music" and follow ogg_play's syntax for 
 files. Defaults to "playlist".

- ogg_sequence {next | prev | random | loop | none}
 When a file ends, start playing another one, depending on the value:
  * next: play the next file.
  * prev: play the previous file.
  * random: play a random file.
  * loop: play the same file again.
  * none: stop playing.
 Defaults to "next".

- ogg_volume
 Volume of the music from 0 to 2. Defaults to "0.7".

3. Configuration
================
While configuring Quake II is straight forward some rogue edges can
arise. Bevor reporting bugs or mailing me please read this section all
the hints covered in it!

3.1 Widescreen
--------------
Yamagi Quake II has full support for widescreen setups. Just select your
favorite resolution and start a game. Now you'll need to adjust the fiel
of view. Open the console with pressing "^" or "~" and set the fov cvar.
Default is 90, I suggest 100 for 16:10 screens and 105 for 16:9.

3.2 Video
---------
For most people the options in the "Video" menu are sufficent. But there
are some things that can and in some cases must be tuned via cvars. Here
the most common questions are answered.

- Sync problems resulting in tearing and artifacts in the lower half of
  the screen: These orginiate in the fact, that 1997 the modern LCD flat
  panel was invented but very expensive and much too slow for gaming.
  Thus Quake II has problems when played on most flat panel monitors.
  The solution for this problem is simple. Just set "cl_maxfps" to the
  double sync frequenzy of your monitor. For most people this is 60hz *
  2 = 120. Now enable the vsync with setting "gl_swapinterval" to 1.
  This should supress all of the problems.

- Particle effects are broken. They're very big, very ugly and very
  slow? This is the fault of Mesa3D and it's broken point parameters
  OpenGL extensions. The only solution is to disable the extension but
  this'll lower the optical quality of the game. Particles won't be any
  longer perfext round but'll have eight edges. Set
  "gl_ext_pointparameters" to 0.

- The game is bright enough but it's also washed out and dull: You need
  more saturation. Just adjust the cvar "intensity". The default 2
  should be enough for most cases, but some setups require higher
  levels.

- Yamagi Quake II offers a lot of predefined resolutions. But it's also
  possible to set custom resolutions via the console: Set gl_customwidth 
  and gl_customheight to the desired values. Change gl_mode to -1 or enter 
  the "Video" menu and select "Custom" as video mode.          

- Yamagi Quake II offers hardware gamma control in realtime via the
  "Video" menu. If Quake II is still too dark set the "vid_gamma" 
  cvar by hand to values above 1.5.

3.3 Input
---------
Quake II had a rather simple input system, even back then in 1997. It
just mapped Windows 95 mouse events one to one on movements. That was a
very acurate way to do it, Quake II was - like all other id Software
games - much more acurate than most games out there. But there were some
problems. First the mouse inut is dependend on the operation system
mouse driver. Another operating system or even another mouse and the
inut changed drasticly. That sucked.

Yamagi Quake II features a from scratch rewritten mouse backend based on
SDL. It gives you exactly the same mouse behavior, regardless of your
operating system or hardware. But sadly it can't emulate the old
behavior in all cases. There are some cvar to adjust:

- in_mouse -> Set to 0 the mouse is disabled. 

- sensitivity -> The sensistivity of the mouse. Adjust to your needs,
  via the cvar or via the "Options" menu.

- in_filter -> A mouse filter. This was added in one of the countless
  point releases but it was broken. We fixed it. The effect is exaktly
  the same as in Quake III Arena, instead of using the raw movement
  signals two of them are combined, filtering vibrations and things like
  that out.

- exponential_speedup -> The mouse acceleration. A very simple aproch,
  much simpler than modern mouse acceleration. "0" is disabled. Sadly
  it's nearly imposible to add modern acceleration to Quake II since
  most of the needed data isn't available to the inut backend.

3.4 Sound
---------
Quake II featured one of the best sound systems of it's time but sadly
it was totaly broken. Therefor id Software rewrote once, later it was
rewritten again for the linux port. That fixed most visible problems but
the code was just crap and broke again as time passed sound on computer
evolved. For Yamagi Quake II 3.0 the sound system was overhauled,
featuring a complete code audit of the upper layers with many bugfixes
and memory leak plugs. The backend was rewritten from scratch. This
should solve most if not all problems.

- The earthquake sound sample is distorted
  This is not a fault of the sound code but of the sound sample itself.
  It's mostly made of very low frequency noices and sampled in only
  22kHz, bringing cheap onboad soundcards to the limit. The only
  solution would be to change the sample...

- The sound is stuttering and cracking
  This is most likely a problem on your side! First make sure that your
  SDL sound backend is installed proberly. Does the sound work in other
  SDL games like ioQuake3? If possible remove all sound servers from
  your stack and use the plain OSS or ALSA via libalsa. If everything
  fails try create an ~/.asoundrc with this contents:

   pcm.!default { 
   type hw 
   card 0 
   } 

   ctl.!default { 
   type hw 
   card 0 
   }

4. Bugreports
=============
Something is not working as expected? An elevator is broken? An enemy
doesn't move? Or the whole game is just crashing? Just drop me an e-mail
to quake2@yamagi.org. Please include a problem description and - if
possible - a screenshot of the problematic situation and the name of the
problematic map. But first, read this little FAQ:

My sound is not working!
 - Most reported sound problems exist between keyboard and chair. Please
   make sure, the the correct SDL sound backend is installed and
   configured! Does the sound work in other SDL games? Does your setup
   support at least five virtual channels? In most cases it's better to
   not use sound servers like Pulseaudio but the plain sound system
   like OSS or ALSA with libalsa instead. Also see the "Sound" section
   in this file!

My OpenGL is not working!
 - Make sure, that OpenGL is working in other games. Use "glxinfo" and
   "glxgears" to make sure, that hardware rendering ist available.
   Otherwise, fix your setup. If reporting OpenGL bugs please include a
   copy of your xorg.conf (if available) and the Xorg.0.log.

The game is crashing!
 - Make sure that your kit is complete. Missing files will crash Quake
   II on random occasions and will produce strange backtraces! This just
   wastes my time, so please check first and report then!

Valgrind reports many, many memory leaks!
 - Yeah it does. But they're all false positives due to Quake IIs
   caching architecture. There some real memory leaks in SDL, Mesa3D,
   X11 and so on but they're out of my scope. So before reporting memory
   leaks please read the code, understand the code and be sure that's a
   real leak!

===============================================================================

5. FAQ
======

How do I open the console?
 - Press "^" or "~", depending on your keyboard layout. 

How do I get the frame counter?
 - Set cl_drawfps to 1

How do I make a benchmark?
 - Set timedemo to 1 and play a demo.

How do I play demos?
 - "demomap name.dm2". Remember, the extension .dm2 is important!

How do I record a demo?
 - "record name" and "stop" to stop.

When playing in window mode my is locked onto the window. Can I change
that, e.g. that Quake II is behaving like a normal window?
 - Open the console with pressing ~ or ^. If you want Quake II to never 
   grab the mouse set "in_grab" to 0, if Quake II should never release 
   the mouse set 1, for releasing the mouse when open the console set 
   to 2. The default is 2.

Hey, my screensaver crashes Quake II or I expire strange crashes after a
fixed amount of time!
 - This is a known bug in some linux distributions. SDL fails to disable
   the screensaver even if we tell him to do so. See this Ubuntu bugreport: 
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/32457
   As a work around use the startscript in tools/quake-start.sh It
   deactivates the screensaver before starting Quake II and reenables it
   after exiting the game.

Are there bots for Quake II?
 - Yes there are a lot of bots. At least JABot ist known to work with
   Yamagi Quake II, take a look at http://deponie.yamagi.org/quake2/stuff/ 
   for the source code. But if you want bots you're most likely a
   deathmatch player and should maybe look for another client.

Okay, Yamagi Quake II is for single player and coop. But what's with us
deathmatch and / or CTF freaks?
 - Use another client. There are clients out there which offer a far
   better multiplayer experiences. They're featuring a greatly improved
   network code and a better client<->server integration. Take a look at
   EGL, r1q2 or AprQ2. At least r1w2 should work on unixlike operating
   systems.
