								    TODO List

=============================================================================== 

This is a list of features that are currently not implemented in Yamagi Quake
II, but would be nice to have. If you have some freetime to spare, fun coding or
just want to contribute something, this list has some suggestions. All tasks
need strong C knowledge, the necessary amount of understandig of the Quake II
source code or external ABIs differs between the tasks.

Some hints:
- Sign up for a Github account and fork our yquake2 repository. This allows 
  the easy integration of upstream changes into your branch and sending of
  pull requests. You'll get a wiki and a bugtracker for free.
- To contribute your changes back into the main project send pull requests
  via Github. It's much easier to review and merge pull requests than patches.
  Please send only pull reqeuests from a distinct branch at not from your
  "master" branch!
- Quake II has a very fragile and broken codebase. Even after years of cleanup
  it's still a disaster. Therefore: 
  - Do only one change at a time!
  - Test after each change (play at least through base1.bsp)
  - Commit early and commit often to create a fine grained history.
    This helps "git bisect" to find bugs and errors.
  - Do not try to clean up things or even rewrite code that you do not
    understand to 110%! Even small behavioral changes can introduce 
    gameplay changes and trigger new bugs! Especially everything that
    depends on map data (e.g. path finding or collision detection) is
    very likely to break in interesting ways!
- Do not add new dependencies. If you must add a new one contact the Yamagi
  Quake II developers prior to it! Everything that adds dependencies should
  be hided behint preprocessor macros.
- If your changes change the gameplay experience, make them optional by
  introducing a new cvar. 
- Linux is not the only operating system out there. All changes should be
  portable to other platform (writing pure ANSI-C or C99 is recommended but
  not always applicable).
- x86 ist not the only CPU architecture. All changes should be done in pure
  C (e.g. no inline assembler) and in an endianess independed way.
- gcc is not the only compiler. Test your changes with clang.

=============================================================================== 

1. Port Yamagi Quake II to Microsoft Windows

Difficulty: Hard
Knowledge: Microsoft Windows, good understanding of the Quake II source,
           SDL-ABI, experience with 64 bit problems

While Quake II was released on Microsoft Windows, support for the plattform was
removed in the early stages of Yamagi Quake II. Looking back this was a bad
decision. Goal of this project is a backport to Microsoft Windows. This
requieres at least three steps:
1. Import the platform specific stuff for Windows from Icculus Q2, clean it up
   and bring it to feature parity with the Unix stuff in src/unix. The nativ
   sound, render and input backends should be replaced by the SDL backends in
   src/sdl.
2. Go through the source and remove all unixisms.
3. Since Windows 64 has another binary model than all unixoid platform there
   will most likely new 64 bit problems. Identify and resolve these.

=============================================================================== 

2. Port Yamagi Quake II to new unixoid platforms (DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
   (Open)Solaris, etc.)

Difficulty: Medium
Knowledge: Good knowledge of the target platform

Yamagi Quake II runs fine on Linux and FreeBSD. Due to it's very low hardware
requirements it's an ideal game for platforms without good 3D acceleration.
Ports to new unixoid operating systems should be easy. In most cases only some
#ifdef need to be added and the Makefile integration written.

=============================================================================== 

3. Source code cleanup

Difficulty: Hard
Knowledge: Good knowledge of the Yamagi Quake II source

While the Yamagi Quake II source code was cleaned a few times there is still
much left to do. Someone need to go through the source, read and audit it. Dead
code should be removed, inefficient functions rewritten and bugs resolved. This
can be done at one module (e.g. client, server, refresher, game, etc) at a time.

=============================================================================== 

4. Addon cleanup

Difficulty: Medium
Knowledge: How to debug hard to read code

While the baseq2 game modul was cleaned up and made more robust by adding
hundreds of sanity checks both addons (xatrix and rogue) still require a lot
of work. Go through the code, read it and understand it. Remove bugs, and add
the missing sanity checks. Test (e.g. play) and add implement map quirks.
Especially the coop-support of both addons is still fragile at best.

=============================================================================== 

5. Finish the port of Zaero

Difficulty: Hard
Knowledge: How to work with broken code

Zaero is an unofficial but popular addon to Quake II. It was release as
freeware. The Yamagi Quake II did an inital port, but it's unfinished and
still buggy. Grab the source (take a look at our Github organization), clean
it and debug it. Zaero will need some extensive testing, have fun while
playing :)
