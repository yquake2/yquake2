=============================================================================== 

At this time there're no open tasks regaring Quake II. Nevertheless the hints
for working with the code:

- Sign up for a Github account and fork our yquake2 repository. This allows 
  the easy integration of upstream changes into your branch and sending of
  pull requests. You'll get a wiki and a bugtracker for free.
- To contribute your changes back into the main project send pull requests
  via Github. It's much easier to review and merge pull requests than patches.
  Please send only pull reqeuests from a distinct branch at not from your
  "master" branch!
- Quake II has a very fragile and broken codebase. Even after years of cleanup
  it's still a disaster. Therefore: 
  - Do only one change at a time!
  - Test after each change (play at least through base1.bsp)
  - Commit early and commit often to create a fine grained history.
    This helps "git bisect" to find bugs and errors.
  - Do not try to clean up things or even rewrite code that you do not
    understand to 110%! Even small behavioral changes can introduce 
    gameplay changes and trigger new bugs! Especially everything that
    depends on map data (e.g. path finding or collision detection) is
    very likely to break in interesting ways!
- Do not add new dependencies. If you must add a new one contact the Yamagi
  Quake II developers prior to it! Everything that adds dependencies should
  be hided behint preprocessor macros.
- If your changes change the gameplay experience, make them optional by
  introducing a new cvar. 
- Linux is not the only operating system out there. All changes should be
  portable to other platform (writing pure ANSI-C or C99 is recommended but
  not always applicable).
- x86 ist not the only CPU architecture. All changes should be done in pure
  C (e.g. no inline assembler) and in an endianess independed way.
- gcc is not the only compiler. Test your changes with clang.
