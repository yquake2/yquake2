# Yamagi Quake II

This is the Yamagi Quake II Client, an enhanced version of id Software's Quake
II with focus on offline and coop gameplay. Both the gameplay and the graphics
are unchanged, but many bugs if the last official release were fixed and some
nice to have features like widescreen support and a modern OpenGL 3.2 renderer
were added. Unlike most other Quake II source ports Yamagi Quake II is fully 64
bit clean. It works perfectly on modern processors and operating systems. Yamagi
Quake II runs on nearly all common platforms; including FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD,
Windows and OS X (experimental).

This code is build upon Icculus Quake II, which itself is based on Quake II
3.21. Yamagi Quake II is released under the terms of the GPL version 2. See the
LICENSE file for further information.
